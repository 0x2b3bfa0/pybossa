==================================
Welcome to PyBossa's documentation
==================================

PyBossa is an open source platform for crowd-sourcing online (volunteer)
assistance to perform tasks that require human cognition, knowledge or
intelligence (e.g. image classification, transcription, information location
etc). 

PyBossa was inspired by the BOSSA_ crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks application
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!
